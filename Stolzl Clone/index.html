          As a German textile artist, she played a crucial role in shaping the
          weaving workshop of the Bauhaus school. Her contributions were
          instrumental in transforming the workshop from producing traditional,
          one-of-a-kind pieces to creating innovative and functional designs for
          the modern industry.

            Her textile creations are considered emblematic of the unique style
            of Bauhaus textiles. She enrolled in the Bauhaus as a student in
            1919 and was later appointed a junior master in 1927. However, she
            was dismissed in 1931 due to political reasons, just two years
            before the Nazis forced the closure of the Bauhaus. When she first
            began her career, the textile department was an overlooked area of
            the Bauhaus, and its current masters lacked expertise in the
            technicalities of textile production.

              In no time, she assumed the role of a mentor to fellow students
              and revived the Bauhaus dye studios in 1921. Following a short
              break, Stölzl returned to the school and was appointed as the
              weaving director in 1925, after its move from Weimar to Dessau. In
              this capacity, she broadened the department by expanding its
              weaving and dyeing facilities.
